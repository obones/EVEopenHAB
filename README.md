# EVEopenHAB

This is the EVEopenHAB project, that aims at displaying openHAB sitemaps on an EVE based display

This project is part of a larger element14 roadtest: [Bridgetek Embedded Video Engine  ME817EV + Display](https://www.element14.com/community/roadTests/2325/l/bridgetek-embedded-video-engine-me817ev-display)

It targets the ESP32 platform, connected via SPI to the ME817EV evaluation board from Bridgetek but it should also be capable of connecting to a BT817 chip.
